# YouTube Video Project Data

This repository contains all the collected data associated with my **YouTube video projects**.

## The Goal

My primary aim in making this public is twofold:
1.  **Preserve all my work:** To securely store and prevent the loss of any **Excalidraw files** used in my projects.
2.  **Open Source:** To make all these resources openly accessible to the community.
